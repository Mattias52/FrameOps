# Influencer Outreach Templates

## Quick Tips
- Personalize EVERY message - reference their specific content
- Keep it short (under 150 words)
- Focus on THEIR benefit, not your product
- Don't ask for promotion - offer value first
- Follow up once after 5-7 days, then stop

## Template 1: YouTube Comment (First Contact)

```
Hey [NAME]! Just watched your [SPECIFIC VIDEO TITLE] - the part about [SPECIFIC DETAIL] was super helpful.

Random question: have you ever thought about turning your tutorials into printable step-by-step guides? I built a tool that does this automatically from YouTube videos.

Would love to give you free access if you want to try it with one of your videos. No strings attached!

## Template 2: Instagram/Twitter DM

```
Hey [NAME]! Big fan of your [NICHE] content.

Built something you might find useful - it turns YouTube videos into professional step-by-step guides automatically. Your followers could actually print and follow along.

Want free access to try it? Could be cool for [THEIR SPECIFIC VIDEO/CONTENT TYPE].

No pressure either way!
```

## Template 3: Email (More Formal)

**Subject:** Turn your "[VIDEO TITLE]" into a sellable guide?

```
Hi [NAME],

I'm [YOUR NAME], founder of FrameOps. I've been watching your [NICHE] content for a while - especially loved [SPECIFIC VIDEO].

I built a tool that automatically converts YouTube videos into professional step-by-step guides (SOPs). Basically, your followers could print out your tutorials and actually follow along at the gym/workshop/kitchen.

I'd love to give you free Pro access to try it out. No strings attached - just genuinely think your content would work great with this.

If you're interested, just reply and I'll set you up. Or check it out at frameops.com/creators

Either way, keep making great content!

[YOUR NAME]
```

## Template 4: Follow-Up (5-7 days later)

```
Hey [NAME], just bumping this in case it got buried!

Totally understand if you're not interested - just wanted to make sure you saw it. The offer for free Pro access still stands.

Cheers!
```
